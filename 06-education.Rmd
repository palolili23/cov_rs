This data only contains baseline information for the three cohorts, so we can skip steps 2,3 and 6 described in \@ref(intro)

1. Import data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
educ <- read_sav(here::here("00_raw_data", "education", "Education RS-I-II-III (UNESCO class)_(12-MAR-2015).sav"))

```

2. Rename variable:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
educ <- educ %>%
  rename(education = ses_UNESCO_recoded)

```

3. Add labels to variable
```{r eval = FALSE}

educ <- educ %>%
  mutate(education = labelled(
    education,
    c(
      `Primary education` = 0,
      `lower or intermediate general education OR lower vocational education` = 1,
      `intermediate vocational education OR higher general education` = 2,
      `higher vocational education OR university` = 3)
  ))

```

4. Export:

```{r eval = FALSE}
export(educ, here::here("02_clean_data", "educ.Rdata"))
```
